# Charter v4 Migration Status & Process

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-01
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 (Deconstruction) - 0% Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (100% Complete)
**Goal**: Establish Charter v4 compliance and clean domain boundaries

#### âœ… Completed:
- [x] Headers added to all modules (Charter v4 format)
- [x] Section headers added to all modules
- [x] Domain violations fixed: waybar hardware scripts moved to infrastructure
- [x] Terminology updated: widgets â†’ tools
- [x] Waybar pattern implemented (Charter v4 compliant)
- [x] Infrastructure integration complete (waybar tools)
- [x] Validation toolkit created
- [x] Charter v4 documentation enhanced
- [x] CLAUDE.md created for session continuity
- [x] System services moved from home to infrastructure (user-services.nix created)

**Success Criteria**: `./scripts/validate-charter-v4.sh` passes with zero violations

### Phase 2: Deconstruction & Relocation (In Progress)
**Goal**: Break down monolithic service modules into domain-pure components

#### In Progress:
- [ ] Extract services from modules/services/business/monitoring.nix
- [ ] Extract services from modules/services/business-api.nix

#### Planned:
- [ ] Simplify profile compositions
- [ ] Validate machine configs
- [ ] Performance testing

### Phase 3: Validation (Pending Phase 2 completion)  
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and documentation

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Test all machines build successfully
- [ ] Validate functionality (waybar, GPU tools, etc.)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create migration retrospective

## ðŸ”„ Process for Session Continuity

### Before Each Session:
1. **Read Charter v4**: `docs/CHARTER_v4.md`
2. **Check status**: `docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md` (this file)
3. **Run validation**: `./scripts/validate-charter-v4.sh`
4. **Review CLAUDE.md**: Session guidelines and context

### During Sessions:
1. **Update status** in this file for each completed task
2. **Run validation** after significant changes
3. **Document decisions** and architectural choices
4. **Update phase completion percentages**

### After Each Session:
1. **Final validation run**
2. **Update "Last Updated" date**
3. **Note any blockers or decisions needed**
4. **Commit progress with clear messages**

## ðŸ“Š Current Violations Status

**Last Run**: 2025-09-01 (no charter violations; `sudo nixos-rebuild` command not found)

### Remaining Violations:
None â€” Charter v4 checks pass with zero violations.

### Fixed Violations:
- âœ… Hardware scripts in waybar (moved to infrastructure)
- âœ… Hardware config in services (archived duplicates)
- âœ… All modules have Charter v4 headers
- âœ… Kebab-case naming compliance
- âœ… No hardcoded paths

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. Restore build capability: install Nix to enable `nixos-rebuild` (curl to nixos.org returns 403)
2. Begin Phase 2 tasks (service extraction and cleanup) once build works

## ðŸš¨ Blockers & Decisions Needed

- `nixos-rebuild` unavailable; build tests for Phase 2 cannot run

**Instructions for Claude instances**: Update this file after each significant change. Commit with clear migration progress messages.
