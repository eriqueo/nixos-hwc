# Charter v4 Migration Status & Process

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-28  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 (Foundation) - 90% Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (95% Complete)
**Goal**: Establish Charter v4 compliance and clean domain boundaries

#### âœ… Completed:
- [x] Headers added to all modules (Charter v4 format)
- [x] Section headers added to most modules  
- [x] Domain violations fixed: waybar hardware scripts moved to infrastructure
- [x] Terminology updated: widgets â†’ tools
- [x] Waybar pattern implemented (Charter v4 compliant)
- [x] Infrastructure integration complete (waybar tools)
- [x] Validation toolkit created
- [x] Charter v4 documentation enhanced
- [x] CLAUDE.md created for session continuity
- [x] System services moved from home to infrastructure (user-services.nix created)

#### ðŸš§ Remaining (Phase 1):
- [ ] Fix remaining hardware scripts violation in `modules/home/eric.nix`
- [ ] Re-run section header script (some files missing sections again)
- [ ] Achieve zero Charter v4 violations

**Success Criteria**: `./scripts/validate-charter-v4.sh` passes with zero violations

### Phase 2: Domain Cleanup (Pending Phase 1 completion)
**Goal**: Clean up complex interdependencies and service architecture

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Review service interdependencies (media/* stack)  
- [ ] Simplify profile compositions
- [ ] Validate machine configs
- [ ] Performance testing

### Phase 3: Validation (Pending Phase 2 completion)  
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing and documentation

#### Planned Tasks:
- [ ] Test all machines build successfully
- [ ] Validate functionality (waybar, GPU tools, etc.)
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Create migration retrospective

## ðŸ”„ Process for Session Continuity

### Before Each Session:
1. **Read Charter v4**: `docs/CHARTER_v4.md`
2. **Check status**: `docs/MIGRATION_STATUS.md` (this file)
3. **Run validation**: `./scripts/validate-charter-v4.sh`
4. **Review CLAUDE.md**: Session guidelines and context

### During Sessions:
1. **Update status** in this file for each completed task
2. **Run validation** after significant changes
3. **Document decisions** and architectural choices
4. **Update phase completion percentages**

### After Each Session:
1. **Final validation run**
2. **Update "Last Updated" date**
3. **Note any blockers or decisions needed**
4. **Commit progress with clear messages**

## ðŸ“Š Current Violations Status

**Last Run**: 2025-08-28 (Post system-services fix)

### Remaining Violations:
1. **Hardware scripts in home/**: `modules/home/eric.nix`
   - **Issue**: Still contains hardware-related configurations that should be in infrastructure
   - **Fix needed**: Identify and move remaining hardware-related code
   - **Progress**: System services moved to infrastructure/user-services.nix âœ…
   - **Status**: PARTIAL FIX APPLIED

2. **Missing section headers**: ~11 files (regressed)
   - **Issue**: Section headers missing from various files
   - **Fix needed**: Re-run `./scripts/add-section-headers.sh --all`
   - **Blocker**: None - can be automated
   - **Status**: NEEDS RE-APPLICATION

### Fixed Violations:
- âœ… Hardware scripts in waybar (moved to infrastructure)
- âœ… Hardware config in services (archived duplicates)
- âœ… All modules have Charter v4 headers
- âœ… Kebab-case naming compliance
- âœ… No hardcoded paths

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Actions (Priority Order)

**PROGRESS**: 2/2 violation categories remain, infrastructure modules created âœ…

1. **Fix eric.nix hardware groups** - Move extraGroups hardware references to infrastructure
2. **Debug section headers regression** - Files keep losing section headers
3. **Achieve Phase 1 completion** (zero violations)
4. **Document Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 handoff**

**FILES CREATED THIS SESSION**:
- `modules/infrastructure/user-services.nix` - System services for user environment
- `modules/infrastructure/user-hardware-access.nix` - Hardware permissions and tmpfiles

## ðŸš¨ Blockers & Decisions Needed

- **eric.nix system services**: Where should user-specific systemd services live?
- **Phase boundary criteria**: Exact definition of Phase 1 completion
- **Testing approach**: How to validate functionality during migration

**Instructions for Claude instances**: Update this file after each significant change. Commit with clear migration progress messages.
