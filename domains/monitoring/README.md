# domains/monitoring/ — Monitoring Domain

## Purpose

Self-contained observability stack: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, cAdvisor, Exportarr, Homepage dashboard, and Uptime Kuma.
Other domains register their scrape configs via `hwc.monitoring.prometheus.scrapeConfigs`.

## Boundaries

- Owns: metrics collection, dashboards, alerting, uptime monitoring, service dashboard, alert source detection
- Does NOT own: alert delivery (that's `domains/notifications/`), workflow automation (that's n8n in `domains/automation/`)
- External integrations: Immich, Frigate, and *arr containers push their scrape configs here

## Changelog

- 2026-06-29: Homepage tiles repointed at name-based vhosts (`<name>.hwc.iheartwoodcraft.com`, ee9f1f17) and a new "Apps & Tools" group added (Uptime Kuma, Lead Scout, Hermes, SR Analyzer, Heartwood CMS, Calibre); static dashboards (calculator, briefing, market-dashboard, market-intelligence, estimator) migrated onto vhost-static via the networking change (ed10482b) — bespoke estimator Caddy block folded into the shared wildcard cert / routes system, closing 4 static ports. Bulk port-mode → name-based vhost migration landed earlier (8fdee440).
- 2026-06-04: Retired the duplicate script-based disk alerter (`alerts/` `sources.diskSpace`); Prometheus is now the sole disk-alert owner. Salvaged its critical-on-data-volumes logic into `HighDiskUsage` (95% P5), which now matches `/|/mnt/.*` instead of root-only — so a full `/mnt/media` or `/mnt/hot` raises P5, not just P4.
- 2026-06-04: Raised `ModerateDiskUsage` threshold 75% → 82% (`prometheus/parts/alerts.nix`). Root `/` baselines ~77%, so the 75% P3 alert fired permanently and Alertmanager re-sent it to Discord every 4h (repeat_interval) with no actionable signal — the dominant disk-alert spam. 82% sits above baseline, below the Elevated (85%) tier.
- 2026-06-04: Raised `PersonaDaemonReindexStale` threshold 1h → 7h (`prometheus/parts/alerts.nix`). The daemon only reindexes on content change with a 6h backstop reconcile (`persona-daemon/index.nix`, `OnUnitActiveSec=6h`), so the old 1h threshold fired on every quiet-vault period — a guaranteed false positive. 7h = 6h backstop + 1h margin.
- 2026-04-04: Added alerts/ subdir — alert sources, thresholds, severity mapping (from domains/alerts redistribution)
- 2026-03-27: Fixed alertmanager routing — default receiver was empty (alerts silently dropped). Now uses child routes with `continue: true` to fan out to all configured webhook receivers. Added ntfy-bridge as second receiver alongside n8n-webhook.
- 2026-03-04: Namespace migration hwc.server.native.monitoring.* → hwc.monitoring.*
- 2026-03-04: Moved from domains/server/native/monitoring/ (Phase 4 of DDD migration)
- 2026-03-27: Added Homepage (gethomepage) service dashboard and Uptime Kuma uptime monitor
