# domains/monitoring/ — Monitoring Domain

## Purpose

Self-contained observability stack: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, cAdvisor, Exportarr, Homepage dashboard, and Uptime Kuma.
Other domains register their scrape configs via `hwc.monitoring.prometheus.scrapeConfigs`.

## Boundaries

- Owns: metrics collection, dashboards, alerting, uptime monitoring, service dashboard, alert source detection
- Does NOT own: alert delivery (that's `domains/notifications/`), workflow automation (that's n8n in `domains/automation/`)
- External integrations: Immich, Frigate, and *arr containers push their scrape configs here

## Changelog

- 2026-06-04: Raised `PersonaDaemonReindexStale` threshold 1h → 7h (`prometheus/parts/alerts.nix`). The daemon only reindexes on content change with a 6h backstop reconcile (`persona-daemon/index.nix`, `OnUnitActiveSec=6h`), so the old 1h threshold fired on every quiet-vault period — a guaranteed false positive. 7h = 6h backstop + 1h margin.
- 2026-04-04: Added alerts/ subdir — alert sources, thresholds, severity mapping (from domains/alerts redistribution)
- 2026-03-27: Fixed alertmanager routing — default receiver was empty (alerts silently dropped). Now uses child routes with `continue: true` to fan out to all configured webhook receivers. Added ntfy-bridge as second receiver alongside n8n-webhook.
- 2026-03-04: Namespace migration hwc.server.native.monitoring.* → hwc.monitoring.*
- 2026-03-04: Moved from domains/server/native/monitoring/ (Phase 4 of DDD migration)
- 2026-03-27: Added Homepage (gethomepage) service dashboard and Uptime Kuma uptime monitor
