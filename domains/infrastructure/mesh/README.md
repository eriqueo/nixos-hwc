# Infrastructure Mesh Bucket

## Purpose

The **Mesh Bucket** provides **service ‚Üî service and service ‚Üî network integration glue**. These modules handle the networking layer that connects services to each other and to external networks without implementing the services themselves.

**Key Principle**: Mesh bucket provides the "network plumbing" between services - container networks, service discovery, load balancing, and inter-service communication.

## Current Modules

### üê≥ Container Networking (`container-networking.nix`)
**Inter-container communication and network integration**

**Status**: Currently a placeholder module designed for future container networking needs.

**Intended Provides:**
- Container-to-container networking setup
- Service mesh integration for containerized services  
- Network overlay configuration
- Inter-service communication routing

**Future Option Pattern:**
```nix
hwc.infrastructure.mesh.containerNetworking = {
  enable = true;
  networks = {
    services = {
      subnet = "10.200.0.0/24";
      services = [ "ollama" "jellyfin" "radarr" "sonarr" ];
    };
    monitoring = {
      subnet = "10.201.0.0/24"; 
      services = [ "prometheus" "grafana" ];
    };
  };
  serviceMesh = {
    enable = true;
    provider = "consul" | "istio" | "linkerd";
  };
};
```

## Future Mesh Capabilities

### Service Discovery Integration
```nix
hwc.infrastructure.mesh.serviceDiscovery = {
  enable = true;
  provider = "consul";
  services = {
    ollama = { port = 11434; health = "/health"; };
    jellyfin = { port = 8096; health = "/System/Ping"; };
  };
};
```

### Load Balancing Glue
```nix  
hwc.infrastructure.mesh.loadBalancing = {
  enable = true;
  frontends = {
    web = {
      domain = "*.local";
      backends = [ "jellyfin" "radarr" "sonarr" ];
      ssl = true;
    };
  };
};
```

### Network Policy Integration
```nix
hwc.infrastructure.mesh.networkPolicies = {
  enable = true;
  policies = {
    media-services = {
      allow = [ "jellyfin" "radarr" "sonarr" ];
      deny = [ "ollama" ];  # AI services isolated from media
    };
  };
};
```

## Mesh Integration Patterns

### Service-to-Service Communication
```nix
# Services domain declares what it needs
hwc.services.radarr = {
  enable = true;
  # Service declares its communication needs
  requires = [ "qbittorrent" "prowlarr" ];
};

# Mesh domain wires them together  
hwc.infrastructure.mesh.containerNetworking = {
  enable = true;
  # Mesh handles the network plumbing
  networks.media-stack = [ "radarr" "qbittorrent" "prowlarr" ];
};
```

### External Network Integration
```nix
# System domain provides network interfaces
networking.interfaces.eth0.ipv4.addresses = [{ address = "192.168.1.100"; prefixLength = 24; }];

# Mesh domain provides service exposure
hwc.infrastructure.mesh.externalAccess = {
  services = {
    jellyfin = { port = 8096; interface = "eth0"; };
    radarr = { port = 7878; interface = "tailscale0"; };  # VPN only
  };
};
```

### Cross-Domain Network Flow
```
Services Domain ‚Üí declares service communication needs
       ‚Üì
Mesh Domain ‚Üí provides network integration between services  
       ‚Üì
System Domain ‚Üí provides underlying network interfaces
       ‚Üì
Security Domain ‚Üí provides firewall rules and access control
```

## Implementation Strategy

The mesh bucket follows a **gradual implementation approach**:

### Phase 1: Container Networking (Current)
- Placeholder module for future container networking
- Basic network isolation between service groups
- Integration with existing Podman/Docker setup

### Phase 2: Service Discovery  
- Automatic service registration and discovery
- Health checking integration
- DNS-based service resolution

### Phase 3: Load Balancing & Routing
- Reverse proxy integration (Caddy/Traefik)
- SSL termination and certificate management
- Request routing based on service topology

### Phase 4: Service Mesh
- Full service mesh integration (Consul Connect, Istio)  
- mTLS between services
- Advanced traffic management and observability

## Data Flow Examples

### Container Service Communication
```
Service A ‚Üí requests connection to Service B
       ‚Üì
Mesh networking ‚Üí routes via container network bridge
       ‚Üì  
Network policy ‚Üí validates connection is allowed
       ‚Üì
Service B ‚Üí receives connection on internal network
```

### External Service Access
```
External Client ‚Üí connects to public IP:port
       ‚Üì
System firewall ‚Üí allows connection (security domain)
       ‚Üì
Mesh load balancer ‚Üí routes to healthy service instance
       ‚Üì
Container network ‚Üí delivers to service container
       ‚Üì
Service ‚Üí processes request and responds
```

## Validation & Troubleshooting

### Container Network Connectivity
```bash
# Check container networks
podman network ls

# Test inter-container connectivity  
podman exec service-a ping service-b

# Check network policies
iptables -L | grep -i docker
```

### Service Discovery
```bash
# Check service registration
consul members

# Test service resolution
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 jellyfin.service.consul
```

### Load Balancer Status  
```bash
# Check reverse proxy status
systemctl status caddy

# Verify backend health
curl -I http://localhost:8096/health
```

## Anti-Patterns

**‚ùå Don't implement services in mesh bucket**:
```nix
# Wrong - service implementation belongs in services domain
systemd.services.jellyfin = { ... };
```

**‚ùå Don't handle authentication/authorization**:
```nix
# Wrong - security policies belong in security domain  
services.oauth2-proxy = { ... };
```

**‚ùå Don't configure system networking directly**:
```nix
# Wrong - basic networking belongs in system domain
networking.interfaces.eth0 = { ... };
```

**‚úÖ Do provide service interconnection**:
```nix
# Correct - wiring services together
virtualisation.oci-containers.networks = {
  media-stack = { driver = "bridge"; };
};
```

**‚úÖ Do integrate with other domains**:
```nix
# Correct - consuming from hardware for network interfaces
config = lib.mkIf (config.hwc.infrastructure.hardware.networking.interfaces != {}) {
  # Use detected interfaces for service exposure
};
```

**‚úÖ Do provide stable interfaces for services**:
```nix
# Correct - services can declare networking needs
options.hwc.infrastructure.mesh.expose = lib.mkOption {
  type = lib.types.attrsOf serviceExposureType;
  description = "Services to expose on the network";
};
```

## Relationship to Other Domains

### With Services Domain
- **Services declare**: What they need to communicate with
- **Mesh provides**: The network plumbing to make it work

### With Security Domain  
- **Security declares**: Access policies and firewall rules
- **Mesh implements**: Network segmentation to enforce policies

### With System Domain
- **System provides**: Basic networking interfaces and capabilities  
- **Mesh builds**: Service networking on top of system networking

### With Hardware Domain
- **Hardware detects**: Available network interfaces and capabilities
- **Mesh consumes**: Network hardware for service connectivity

The mesh bucket is currently in **early development** but designed to provide comprehensive **service networking integration** as the system grows more complex. It maintains clean separation from service implementation while providing the essential network glue services need to communicate effectively.
